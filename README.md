# Grpc
A modern open source high performance remote procedural call is a form of Client-Server Communication that uses a function call rather than a usual HTTP call.
Famuous for getting data from one micro service to another.
In a few days, I'll be using gRPC with Golang, it is an amazing language. Must learn
